## Shared Resources Travel Agent

### Project Lead: [Richie Reich](richie.reich@moffitt.org)

**Background**: 
Investigators at Moffitt don't always know where to go or who to contact for
help from one of the many available shared resources.  This tool will use
generative AI to discern needs from conversational prompts with the purpose of
connecting investigators to the right shared resource(s).
 
**Project Significance**: 
This project can help Moffitt researchers identify the best way to get help from
Shared Resources. It will help facilitate access to and increase project work
for the shared resources.

**Technical Specifications or Programming background**:
Technical skills: Prompt engineering, LLM’s, RAG Programming Language: Python
