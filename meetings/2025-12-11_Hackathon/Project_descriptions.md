# Hackathon Projects 2025

## Shared Resources Travel Agent

### Project Lead: [Richie Reich](richie.reich@moffitt.org)

**Background**: 
Investigators at Moffitt don't always know where to go or who to contact for
help from one of the many available shared resources.  This tool will use
generative AI to discern needs from conversational prompts with the purpose of
connecting investigators to the right shared resource(s).
 
**Project Significance**: 
This project can help Moffitt researchers identify the best way to get help from
Shared Resources. It will help facilitate access to and increase project work
for the shared resources.

**Technical Specifications or Programming background**:
Technical skills: Prompt engineering, LLM’s, RAG Programming Language: Python

## A Directory of Immune and Oncological Studies (ADIOS) Cancer

### Project Lead: [Joshua Davis](JOSHUA.DAVIS@moffitt.org)

**Background**: 
We have established an initial repository of publicly available scRNAseq,
RNAseq, and microarray data https://biostools.moffitt.org/4472414/Shiny/ADIOS_Cancer/. 
We have established several resources for real-time analysis of these public
data sets. We aim to expand the resource with 50 studies over the course of the
hackathon.
 
**Project Significance**: 
The repository will facilitate easy access to public data for the Moffitt
community. This will also facilitate the generation of a gene signature specific
to IO treatment, drug response, and cell types for downstream bioinformatics
analysis.
 
**Technical Specifications or Programming background**: 
Learn the basics of bioinformatics gene expression analysis.
R script, R Shiny app, and Web Development
