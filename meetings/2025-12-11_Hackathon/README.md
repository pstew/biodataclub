# December 2025 The Sixth Annual Bio-Data Club Hackathon

## Hackathon Details

<!-- Registration for the Bio-Data Club's Annual Hackathon 
[is now open](https://forms.office.com/r/xaXkA6aPMW)! -->
 
The hackathon will commence  virtually on Thursday, December 11th, 2025 at 10am and conclude with virtual project presentations on Friday, December 12th at 3pm. A hackathon is an event in which participants come together to build a software product during a short period of time. [Here is a short article](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/what-is-a-hackathon/) describing what you can expect. [Previous yearâ€™s hackathon](https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/tree/master/meetings/2024-12_Hackathon) featured around 40 participants working collaboratively on **6** projects. 

Participation is completely optional, and Moffitt employees are under no obligation to participate. However, this will be a fun event and we encourage everyone to sign up! The event will be very low stakes, and we encourage friendly competition between teams. The winning team will be awarded a small prize and bragging rights for the year. Since work on hackathon projects will occur during an intensive 1.5 day period, please make sure to obtain permission to participate from your supervisor or PI. 

<!-- ### Special Pilot Grant Announcement

Dr. Brooke Fridley and the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (Bio2) at the Moffitt Cancer Center will award a $25,000 pilot grant to the top placing hackathon team with the following requirements:

- Teams must include a Bio2 faculty member to be eligible for the award.
- The Bio2 faculty member must participate during the entirety of the hackathon.

## Projects
(*coming soon*)
<!-- The list of projects for this year's hackathon [can be found here](https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/blob/master/meetings/2025-12-11_Hackathon/Project_descriptions.md).  -->

## Rules
- Hackathon teams are organized around projects. 
- Teams will be overseen by a team leader (the submitter of the project).
- Participants choose a single team they wish to join during registration. 
- The team leader will be responsible for delegating tasks to team members.
- Teams will have approximately 1.5 days to develop a deliverable product. 
- Each team will have 5 minutes to present their final product on Friday. Product demonstrations or slides will be acceptable.
- A panel of judges will pick the winning project. 
- The top 3 projects will be picked by the judges using the following items:
  - Reproducibility
  - Usability
  - Scientific value
- No work (e.g. writing code, analyzing data) should be performed prior to the start of the hackathon
  - Pre-training models, pre-processing data, or the addition of completely new features to existing code will be acceptable. 
- Participants agree to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/blob/master/meetings/2025-12-11_Hackathon/CoC/code_of_conduct.md).

## Misc.
- Participants will be matched with their team leader approximately three days before the start of the hackathon. Team leaders are highly encouraged to on-board team members at this point. This will give teams time to complete setup tasks (e.g. read background material, download data, install packages, etc.) so they can hit the ground running on the day of the hackathon. 
- Some programming background in any language is recommended but not required. 
  - If you are not confident in your programming skills, then there may be non-programming tasks such as finding validation datasets, cleaning data, creating figures, or creating slides for the results presentation that will still allow you to participate. 
- There are a number of tools to make collaboration during a virtual hackathon more easy. In no particular order:
  - zoom: chat, video chat, screen sharing
  - Google Docs: share notes in real time; simulatenously edit documents (including presentation slides)
  - Google Drive: shared cloud folder for sharing files 
  - git/github: work on the same code simultaneously
